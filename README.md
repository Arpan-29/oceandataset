Sub-surface information of the ocean like the mixed layer depth (MLD), sonic layer depth (SLD), tropical cyclone heat potential (TCHP) etc. is very useful in wide variety of applications such as air-sea interaction studies, Naval applications, cyclone genesis and forecasting etc. This information is available either from in situ measurements or from Numerical models. In situ measurements in the ocean are quite sparse while the numerical models have inherent errors in simulating this information. Satellites provide wide spatial coverage of the oceans; however, they only give ocean surface information. Assuming that the derived quantities of the deeper ocean such as MLD, SLD, TCHP etc have signatures in the ocean surface as well, an artificial intelligence based technique linking the satellite surface observations of the ocean with these sub-surface quantities, may be envisaged. Satellite observations of sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) and sea surface wind speed (WS) collocated with MLD, SLD, TCHP derived from in situ measurements (ARGO floats/moored buoys) can be used as training data set where we try develop a relationship between SST, SSS, SSHA, WS and the derived quantities MLD, TCHP and SLD. In this problem the participants must develop a software to generate MLD, SLD and TCHP using satellite data (SST, SSS, SSHA, WS)
